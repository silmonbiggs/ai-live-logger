# Resume After Directory Rename

**Date**: October 15, 2025 (Morning Session)
**Status**: 🎯 **99% COMPLETE** - Just needs directory rename

## ✅ What's Been Completed This Session

### Step 1: GitHub Repository Renamed ✅
- Successfully renamed via GitHub web UI
- Old: `chaptgpt-live-logger`
- New: `ai-live-logger`
- URL: https://github.com/silmonbiggs/ai-live-logger

### Step 2: Changes Pushed to GitHub ✅
- All commits successfully pushed
- Remote branch `signal-processing-refactor` cleaned up
- Main branch is up to date with remote

### Step 3: Local Directory Rename ⏳
**STATUS**: Blocked by file lock (VSCode/Claude Code has files open)

**Current location**: `C:\dev\chatgpt-live-logger`
**Target location**: `C:\dev\ai-live-logger`

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

1. **Close VSCode and Claude Code** (you're doing this now)
2. **Rename the directory**:
   - Open Windows Explorer
   - Navigate to `C:\dev`
   - Rename `chatgpt-live-logger` → `ai-live-logger`
   - OR use PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     cd C:\dev
     Rename-Item chatgpt-live-logger ai-live-logger
     ```

3. **Reopen VSCode** in the new location:
   ```
   C:\dev\ai-live-logger
   ```

## ✨ After Directory Rename - Verification Steps

When you reopen VSCode in `C:\dev\ai-live-logger`:

```bash
# Verify git still works
git status

# Verify remote is correct
git remote -v
# Should show: https://github.com/silmonbiggs/ai-live-logger.git

# Test the server
cd server
python ai-live-logger.py
# Should start on localhost:8788

# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8788/health
# Should return: ok
```

✅ GitHub repo: ai-live-logger
